# Build the SPARTA web site with Sphinx.
#
# Sphinx and its dependencies are installed into a virtualenv under
# siteenv the first time a build runs, so the only prerequisite is a
# python3 with venv available.
#
# The manual is not built here.  It is a separate Sphinx project in the
# SPARTA repository, under doc/, and its built pages are copied into doc/
# here when a release is made.  This build leaves doc/ alone.
