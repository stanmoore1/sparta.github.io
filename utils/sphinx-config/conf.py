# SPARTA web site build configuration file.
#
# This is the site -- index, features, papers, the abstracts and the
# benchmark tables.  The manual is a separate Sphinx project, in the SPARTA
# repository under doc/, and is copied in under doc/ here at release time.
# The two are kept apart deliberately: a landing page is not a manual
# chapter, and the manual has its own theme, its own table of contents and
# its own release cycle.  LAMMPS separates them the same way.
#
# Because they are separate, every link from here into the manual is an
# ordinary relative URL (doc/read_surf.html), not a :doc: reference.  There
# are around 400 of them and they resolve against whatever manual is
# sitting in doc/, which is what makes the release-time copy work.
